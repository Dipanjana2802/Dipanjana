Multi-Label Image Classification Model

The objective of this exercise is to identify multiple different objects of interest in any given frame

The uniqueness of building a Multi-Label Image Classification Model lies in its data preparation step:
- A Dataframe needs to be created; format of the dataframe can be found in multi_image_labels.csv
- ImageDataGenerator class from the Keras API then be used to read data from the dataframe

The remaining model training steps are as usual.
Detailed code with step wise explanation is provided in MultiLabel_Processing.py
