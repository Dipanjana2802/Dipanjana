Creating a Deep Neural Network Model utilising Pre-trained model

Framework used: Keras

High Level steps Involved:
- Downloading a pre-trained model using Keras API
- Data set up for specific requirement
- Training new model on top of the pre-trained model following Transfer Learning principle
- Fine tuning of the newly trained model

Detailed code with step wise explanation is provided in Transfer_Learning_Fine_Tuning.py
